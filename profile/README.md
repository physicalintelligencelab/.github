We are the Physical Intelligence Lab, a psychology and neuroscience research group led by Jonathan Tsay (JT), and based at Carnegie Mellon University. Our lab's mission is to understand how humans master a near-limitless repertoire of movements, from brewing coffee to parallel parking. To achieve this, we will use a wide range of methods like computational modeling, psychophysics, and patient testing. We expect our findings to not only generate new insights into learning and memory but also optimize rehabilitation and improve human performance.
