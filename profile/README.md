We are a diverse team of neuroscientists, computer scientists, and engineers 🧠💻🔧 dedicated to understanding how humans master a near-limitless repertoire of movements, from brewing coffee to parallel parking ☕️🚗. Through computational modeling, psychophysics, and patient testing, we aim to elucidate the inner workings of the human brain and its influence on behavior + motor skills.

*We expect our findings to not only generate new insights into learning and memory but also optimize rehabilitation and improve human performance. ✨ 🎯*
